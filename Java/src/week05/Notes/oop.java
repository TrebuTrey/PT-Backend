		 * Four Pillars of Object Oriented Programming
		 * 
		 * 1. Abstraction
		 * - Learn to keep main files simple and clean.
		 * 
		 * 2. Encapsulation
		 * - Functions and variables that do not need to be accessed
		 * by other parts of the program should not be facing outward
		 * 
		 * 3. Inheritance
		 * - Simplifying the dependencies and reusing structures
		 * from parent to child classes
		 * 
		 * 4. Polymorphism
		 * - Methods and functions can take different forms
		 * 
		 * Class is the blueprint
		 * Object is the product of the blueprint
		 * Object is an instance of the class
