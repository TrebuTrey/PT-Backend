		 * Exceptions are breaks in the code that will not allow

		 * Checked Exceptions
		 * - Explicit checks in the code
		 * try, catch block - handles exceptions
		 * 
		 * example: 
		 * 
		 * try {
		 * 	TODO
		 * } catch(Exception e) {
		 * 	sysout(e.tostring());
		 * } finally {
		 * 	we can force something to run at all times with the 
		 * 	optional finally
		 * }
		 * 
		 * Unchecked Exceptions
		 * - Thrown due to problems in the code that are not 
		 * validated. This can be avoided by following better coding
		 * practices
		 * 
		 * 
		 * A method signature can also include the optional argument
		 * of an exception being thrown
		 * 
		 * example:
		 * 
		 * public static FileReader someFile(String file) throws FileNotFoundException {
		 * 	TODO
		 * }
